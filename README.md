**AI Agent that uses A* algorithm to find the best path available in a procedurally generated dungeon in Godot 4.1*

Our "Player" starts at a random room in the map and has to go to an also random point on the gridmap.

## Project Description
The logic im using here is from a [Unity Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBY2Dzej03A&ab_channel=Vazgriz) that explains basics of gridmaps, procedural generetaion, delaunay triangulation, etc.
There is also material made for godot that explains most of the tile creation, specially [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h64U6j_sFgs&ab_channel=quwatz_).

Player scene and dungeon meshes are random itch.io assets. 
And the code for the Player movement and pathfinding it's all in godots methods.
You can play with the project however you want making it bigger, more rooms or changing the logic.
